Pros-Very light weight-Non-bulky-Great Color-Raised edge around screen-minimal shock protection-great scratch protection-great grip-perfect cut-outs-easy to put on-just-right fitCons-No shock protection from flat-face fall This case is durable,1
- It is NOT an attractive case .,-1
Add on Classic ( $ 29.95 from Motion Apps ) and you can run most of your old Palm programs on you Pre too.What else ?,1
"If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.",-1
So far I 've cut 4 micro SIM cards down to Nano size and they have all worked flawlessly .,1
Material is good and they do what they should .,1
Good transmit audio.,1
Application was fairly easy ... although tedious in ensuring that no dust or bubbles got between the screen protector and screen .,1
Do you really need such a simple functional product forced in those awful clam shells with a thick mutli-lingual manual and massively expensive packaging ?,-1
You can call this a Chinese made holder .,-1
Waste of 13 bucks.,-1
Phone has not been dropped or abused in any way I baby this phone its my precious . .,0
i will buy again to protect my phone .,1
Pandora runs seamlessly on this device,1
do n't drop it on floor . .,-1
Pros : - Light weight-Thin-Easy to hold-Protects screen-Easy access to phone buttonsCons : - None so farWhen I first received this case,1
I bought this hoping it would fit my kids phone and the rubber is lose around it and the harder case does n't sit flat .,-1
One of my favorite purchases ever.,1
Only two draw backs ... the `` chrome '' messes with the flash and I have noticed a little pealing of the glossy finish on the sides,-1
There are TWO PROFILES available for BTC450 : Phone Audio ( used for initiating or receiving phone calls ) and Media Audio ( used for listening to music via Bluetooth ) .,0
The reception has been generally good.,1
worthless product.,-1
got this case for my cousin,0
The power button is easy to use with this case .,1
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.,1
This charger ensures your battery is fully charged .,1
I t does a great job charging as well it takes to 98 to 99 Percent .,1
It's a great item.,1
This item was really what i expected,1
That 's not the fault of the manufacturer,1
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).,-1
"i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.",1
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.,1
Will buy another from this GTMAX vendor when any scratches on the protector irritate me enough to buy another one :) GOOD pricing,1
I am happy that I can give my wife a great gift replacing her old Windows phone 7.5 .,1
Excellent dual-purpose headset.,1
Works great!.,1
It is a beautiful product and packaged nicely in hard clear shell .,1
"Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.",1
He takes this on road trips so he can keep his phone charged .,1
- Rotates to support both portrait and landscape mode .,1
I wish there were more apps,-1
The battery I received does last longer than what I have in my phone .,1
It has kept up very well.,1
The earpiece fits comfortably behind the ear .,1
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.,1
One size does not fit all .,-1
It protects my phone better than I thought it was going to .,1
I will definitely recommend it .,1
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..,1
But soft cases offer more shock protection ... So a case that combines both is ideal .,1
You could buy about seven of these before even reaching the lowest price that you 'd find on a case in a retail store .,1
This is a good case for the Galaxy S3 phone and it has good material and it is easy to carry .,1
The battery is completely useless to me.,-1
Had n't seen that or told about it from my Carrier .,0
The back of the case can pick up fingerprints,1
I actually liked the instructions as it is relatively comprehensive,1
"I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.",-1
It 's a bit too think on the edges,-1
I nolonger have to sit next to an outlet just to charge my phone .,1
Now about a year later it hums - makes a constant buzzing noise even with only one phone plugged in .,-1
Some dude who was spotting me at the gym,0
"My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.",-1
I 'm just extremely annoyed that the people who produce this product could n't figure this out and pre-cut it FOR me .,-1
I would n't recommend this for lots of use,-1
Works great just like oem .,1
And also fingerprint and oil magnet ... Overall good product,1
"stay away from this store, be careful.",-1
And the red color is not as bright as in the picture - it 's dull,-1
The only drawbacks I see are that the Otterbox offers more robust protection and also has a face plate .,1
My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.,-1
This phone cover came really fast .,1
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.,-1
If you are in love with hello kitty as I am,1
It bows out in the back top and therefore allows the rubbery corner on the top left ( if looking at the front of the unit ) to slip back even more easily that I think was intended .,-1
I 'm very happy with it .,1
My only complaint is that it takes some getting used to removing your phone from the sticky backing .,-1
Because it is a tight fit,1
But it fails at it 's main purpose -- Consistently charging the iphone 3G -- .,-1
I liked the feel and appearance of this case .,1
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!,-1
the fit and finish of this case is REALLY exceptional for the money .,1
This PDA rocks.,1
Don't buy this product - It fails!.,-1
They have a solid feel and fit my big head ok,1
The plastic trim that holds the case on is thin as long as you do n't remove it often you will be fine .,1
Not as good as I had hoped.,-1
More on that below.I say `` little '' because,0
Very good company to deal with .,1
I am one of those people who take my iPad with me for many projects .,0
We use the actual insert for all types of charger accesories .,0
I Was Hoping for More.,-1
I pull the buttom off everynight before bed to put the phone on my ihome and every morning it slides right back together with no losening or anything like that .,1
Micro B connector seems to be very well made and charges at a pretty fast speed .,1
"Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.",1
Jawbone Era is awesome too!,1
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!,-1
After trying Sony and several Nokia headsets found these to be the best,1
&#9830; Has `` Sync-Through '' capabilities that allows you to sync your iPhone without removing the case .,1
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.,1
I like the 8 hur talk time and when positioned correctly the clarity and being able to hear whom I am speaking to .,1
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.,-1
This lets me power up anything with a USB connection .,1
I 've bought 2 of these,0
Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice case for their white S3 .,1
The holster is durable and is convenient .,1
None of the devices ' charging time was noticeably affected or slowed down .,1
There is 1 input port which is a micro-USB,0
It may be related to the injection molding process,0
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!,-1
I'm trying to return it for a refund.,-1
It would be nice to have a better way to carry it,-1
Also feels great when holding the phone .,1
Bear in mind I 'm used to a Nokia E71 phone,0
and the price was to die for !,1
If you watch the videos often some of them get massage saying that you abusing there service or just like me they just kill the speed.UPDATE ... 24 Hours Later I got massage from Them .,-1
The case is great and works fine with the 680.,1
I would say that with the issues I have had,0
I have to go in-between the front seats to the back,0
I was not happy with this item.,-1
My husband has the iPhone 5S and I have an Android phone,0
The BT headset was such a disapoinment.,-1
It 's a plastic two peace case that snaps together .,0
That 's pretty good considering many other batteries would only power the devices and not add much to the charge .,1
Does the app automatically select EQ setting based on genre detection from library ?,0
Did n't last at all .,-1
Freezes frequently4.,-1
Nice packaging ( recycled small brown box ) Great case .,1
Snaped together and looks good .,1
"I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.",1
I was excited to get this because the price was right,1
So as far as extending your time off the charger this battery definitely does that and more.As far as looks I was very surprised .,1
"Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.",1
I 've owned this case for a couple of months now and it 's still great !,1
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.,-1
It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge .,0
"All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.",-1
Cumbersome design.,-1
Stay Away From the Q!.,-1
Not impressed.,-1
One of my biggest pet peeves is if the picture misrepresents the product .,-1
best case i have ever found for the note 3 that is sleek n slim,1
The case also makes it easier to grip the phone .,1
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.,-1
It works as long as your phone or device can be charged with a USB charger .,1
`` Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback .,0
nothing wrong with the case at all !,1
"They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.",1
Its reception is very very poor.,-1
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).,1
"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.",-1
And with the bold colors you probably wo n't have any trouble spotting your phone on the kitchen counter .,1
This does n't heal .,-1
"Nice case, feels good in your hands.",1
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.,1
This phone FOR THE PRICE is the absolute best deal around .,1
I wanted to find just a bumper for this beautiful phone but every case I bought was bulky .,-1
Bad Quality.,-1
Works exactly as it said it would .,1
The screen protector works fine,1
Battery life is also great!,1
I love this case everyone ask me where i bough this,1
Chances are your phone or device will be able to charge completely at least once using it,1
The case is also flimsy and too loose on the sides .,-1
This product was delivered on time,1
This is my third case for ipod touch .,0
The quality is precisely what I expected from Otter Box .,1
Awkward to use and unreliable.,-1
Like other Symbian/S60 phones,1
Both look good on my black iPhone,1
Luckily the unit works by simple contacts that are laid in rows and columns on the Plate and the Phone sleeve has some contacts on the Back that make the connection .,1
I 'll reserve judgement until we use all of them and see how they perform .,0
I have n't really needed the flashlight part yet,0
Sent for this for a friend & he is very pleased with this phone cover .,1
Very good phone.,1
"I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.",-1
Wind completely messes it up,-1
Then they wait for me to call them back .,0
Works with my T-Mobile sim .,1
With this super long cord she can now do so !,1
My screen is still flawless despite drops,1
I 'm not sure what technology is in the UP24 but it tracks ONLY steps and tracks them well .,1
Bought my case after reading all the high rating it received .,0
"I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.",1
Covers everything and has a lip on the front,1
The UNU 2300mAh capacity DX charger case works great at providing a full on-board 100 % recharge for the iPhone 5/5S as well as providing physical protection for the iPhone itself .,1
If you connect it to your computer,0
"I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!",1
It 's easy to control the Vizio with another,1
I know it limits the high resolution of my phone but its worth the trade off for less fingerprints and a usable device in direct sunlight .,1
This is a great device .,1
The build quality is very good and the output is substantial .,1
"It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.",1
After cleaning the screen and applying the film as directed,0
Very happy with a great product at a reasonable price .,1
The ear pieces themselves were very hard to keep in my ears,-1
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!,1
Great pens for my ipad and iPod.The price was very affordable and it came in nice colors.Overall great .,1
"I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.",-1
"However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.",-1
The product build quality is not some thing I was personally satisfied with ... however may be for the price that is what one gets .,-1
I use the cover while I work and have dropped it several times and so far no problems .,1
So far it 's doing a good job .,1
I love this case though,1
Wish i had paid a little more for quality .,-1
They refuse to refund or replace.,-1
It &#8217; s definitely a flip phone .,0
I now have a nasty chip on the right edge of the protector which slowly but surely spread into a nice crack running down to the left bottom corner .,-1
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.,1
I hate that I lost all of my contacts,-1
The USB ports are 1.3,0
Product reviews will help us proactively enhance our customers experience,0
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.,1
Note : be careful where you put the glue,0
It will probably run a gopro for 4 weeks straight !,1
No real improvement.,-1
My iPad was 45 percent charged .,0
These are fabulous!,1
I bought this for my new smart phone to protect it .,0
I decided to put in on my wife 's more relaxed Electra bike .,0
Much different compared to the highly rubberized feel of the defender .,0
I have not researched similar products or price points to compare but am happy with this 5 Star America product .,1
Returned 8 hours later.,-1
I will update my review later down the road with that info .,0
In fact it is the first screen protector I have installed on any device,0
I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.,1
I feel a bit self-conscious about it so I do n't carry it that way very often .,0
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.,1
If you get this case,0
Love this product.,1
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.,1
I would just refrain from using it during exercise.Overall : The LG HBS-700 is a very strong offering .,1
I wo n't buy again .,-1
"Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.",-1
MY NOTE 2 IS MADE EVEN BETTER WITH THESE EXCELLENT CASES .,1
This is a great charger for any phone ( I 'm using it with a Samsung Nexus S ),1
"My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!",-1
ORIGINAL REVIEW : I thought about waiting on the Lumia 925,0
Happy so far!.,1
I like the higher amp charge that even works on my iPad .,1
It 's clear and glossy ( not an anti-glare matte ),0
maybe until the new one is out .,0
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,1
Poor product.,-1
I also wish there were controls on both ears .,-1
Tech Armor makes really great screen protector and we are always pleased .,1
Purchased it for my husbandNice & very manly I would have gave it an 5 star but the orange is to loud This is the second otterbox defender series case I have purchased .,1
I love the green color but it does come in other colors as well .,1
Everything about this product is wrong.First,-1
Same basic application with all the pros and cons,0
The clip is secure on your waistband or pocket .,1
It's pretty easy.,1
The afternoon post delivered the Sendy Power Pack a little over week ago .,0
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros,-1
I have tested it as a speakerphone,0
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.,-1
You can't beat the price on these.,1
Incredible!.,1
With the international adapters you can quickly change to other adapters and keep charging,1
It 's a shame b/c I really do like the style and how easily it folds to put away .,-1
This is a great little item.,1
I got this for my son 's phone .,0
They do happen and they can persist for some time.The cable measures 33 inches long,0
It does provide a good grip and the color really stands out .,1
It was a waste of my money.,-1
I wove this one so much I decided to buy another one just in case I should need .,1
This model is right up there with the best,1
It took me several days and calls to tech support to figure this out .,-1
Better on the protector than on my actual screen and you get THREE screen protectors in a pack,1
"Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.",1
Very prompt service.,1
It 's got a subtle `` wave '' pattern on the backside that helps ensure your phone does n't slide around and stays put.Usually when I pick up a slip case for my iPhone or iTouch,0
I can get on the treadmill and these headphones stay in my ear for the duration .,1
Phone falls out easily.,-1
Great Earpiece.,1
Thank you for such great service.,1
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,1
After a minute or so,0
"It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!",1
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.,-1
The only part of the phone exposed is the trackball .,0
The camera felt fast and didnt hesitate too long between pictures .,1
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,-1
Amazon is really a very good source for so many of these types of items .,1
This is my third Otterbox product and it lives up to the quality I expect from Otterbox .,1
If your a cheetah and hello kitty lover,0
I 'm not pleased that the charger uses a mini-USB ( rather than micro-USB ) to hook into the car mount,-1
The battery works great!,1
I needed the phone in a hurry .,0
it glides freely over your touchscreen device,1
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.,1
It does what you need : charges your more recent Apple devices ( iPhones,1
All the ports and camera/flash are covered for protection .,1
"The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.",-1
Bought this as a gift for my sister for her new phone .,0
If you need high protection this is n't for you ... get an Otterbox .,-1
The cover also protect the screen too .,1
Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!,1
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.,1
The mount arm was VERY solid,1
Is that just a design goof by Jabra or do they not really understand the theory?Because it is motion-activated,-1
It charged my smartphone from about 20 % very quickly ( about an hour ) and after four uses ( charges ) I still have one indicator light of power left .,1
If the bitrate was higher or self ripped,0
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.,1
There is a lot of scary import stuff on here that I have had bad experiences with .,-1
This is probably because the built in screen protector does n't actually touch the screen .,0
Thereare so many times when I have friends riding in my car and we both wantto charge our phones .,0
My headset works just peachy-keen.,1
Tried to glue it but the aftermarket part was just too poorly made I bought two of these to replace some others that have failed in a relatively short period .,-1
My iphone fits perfectly even with the case I have with is always nice to not have to remove it while charging !,1
"This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems",1
At just $ 5.99 for the longer and better durability cord,1
I 'm sure this is because of the dual processor and improved memory in the HTC .4 G is insane !,1
I think their good quality,1
I did n't realize it would be so bulky and not really easy to use with my original phone holster .,-1
I have experienced no issues even with 3 iPhones and an iPad charging at the same time .,1
I gave this a 4 because of some major flaws which are if you are a person like me who has short nails it 's not such a good idea to get this case because the charger port takes some pretty long nails to open .,-1
This is a great deal.,1
My wife and I both use iPhone 4 's .,0
This is a excellent product it has all you need for surfing the net taking pics and listening to your tunes.This products is flawless and works great.If you wo n't a fast big screen handset i will recommend you look at this item.This does run 4g service if you have a gsm provider that offers that service to you and it is unlocked .,1
"Five star Plus, plus.",1
so go share :) and quick to ship !,1
Avoid this one if you can.,-1
Fit is excellent for me,1
This is my 2nd iBolt product and I will bet that you will be very happy with this cradle .,1
Although this unit is a little bigger and heavier than one of our other ones,0
i have always known elago to make good phone cases and this one seems to have lived up to there build quality.The thing i was not too happy about was that the back of the case has a opening in the top corner which leave it open to damage if the phone was to eve fall on that corner .,-1
I 'm going to post this same review on the page for each .,0
The screen protector is scratch proof .,1
The fairy was not as shiny as shown in the picture but I still love it allot !,1
Looks and feels like a toy and arrived broken .,-1
This review is for the Belkin Mirror Screen Protector for Apple iPod Touch 4G .,0
Now that I have an iPod ( wake up Apple - give us BT ) I 'll use the A120 for pairing when I need this style headphone.Overall the cordless convenience is very nice .,1
Item Does Not Match Picture.,-1
This one does the job as the original but is too small in terms of the Note 2 holder .,-1
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.,-1
It 's really convenient to just put your phone on top of the touchstone charger and have it charge without having to plug anything else in !,1
He 's my Appleman and if he ca n't fix it no one can .,-1
Others may have better luck but although I found them to work well at first after a half hour or so at the gym I had to always be putting them back in place .,-1
Same problem as others have mentioned.,-1
Was just right - Mute and volume buttoms pretty easy to use .,1
Another feature built in to it is that you 're supposed to be able to click on the dial tone button and speak a phone number - but when I press that button the Roadster tells me that the feature is unsupported by my phone .,-1
I can take this on the road and power my iPhone and the kids iPods several times over .,1
Great phone.,1
I received it quickly and it works great!!,1
She really liked the cover .,1
The TPU on this case does not feel near as nice as the TPU on Diztronic or Cruzerlite cases .,-1
This battery still could not keep my phone charged or on .,-1
"Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).",-1
In order to hear any music at all,0
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.,-1
It 's 850 mA output wo n't charge an iPad however .,-1
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.,-1
The car chargers would never have kept it charged because it 's slow charging .,-1
I was a little nervous on this,0
"This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.",1
it lost one star for being bulky and making my iphone look like an android phone or as other calls it BIONIC .,-1
google has solved this problem by doing away with a cable entirely.we have a spigen neo hybrid and like other reviews we have noticed the case does not affect charge at all.the only thing it does seem to affect is the magnetic attraction which is to be expected so you have to try a little harder to locate that special spot right in the center.I would have liked a device that matched the exact L&W ; dimensions of the nexus 5 so that there is no guess work when laying the device down .,0
I was pretty excited to finally get bluetooth in my car .,1
"sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.",-1
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!,1
When I shop for a phone case,0
cool phone.,1
There 's nothing rubber about it .,1
The first time I tried to remove it I almost broke out in a sweat,-1
Worked perfectly!,1
The number one complaint is that the case can get slippery .,-1
In addition i wore nonlatex gloves which I washing just to make sure no dust transfer .,0
Definitely a bargain.,1
I like this it has performed well and even after a year of use still has not broken down like other cheap ear phones .,1
"I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.",1
Does n't provide any kind of protection .,-1
A beautifully designed phone deserves a cover that protects it and shows it off at the same time .,1
Bet he would have loved this Bluetooth headset which really is super lightweight compared to others I 've tried - the lack of bulkiness particularly important to people like me who need the lightest weight possible on their sensitive ears !,1
"Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.",1
None of the flaps will stay closed .,-1
As one other person mentioned,0
Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.,-1
This is a nice charger .,1
Verizon ( the underlying network TracFone uses for this phone ) is excellent in my area so I did n't expect any problems with call quality and have n't had any .,1
Not having to worry about charging or dying batteries has been amazing .,1
Customer service was terrible.,-1
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!,1
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.,1
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,-1
That 's with minimal removal of the skin .,0
AND it wo n't die when accidentally dropped into the toilet .,1
Also outputs 2.1 Amps and charges my Android phone at the AC rate and not the USB rate which is good .,1
Not as vibrant of a color as the picture shows but still is pretty cool .,1
But that 's a change I 'm willing to make for such an otherwise delightful phone .,1
GREAT FOR YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE .,1
also the i dont like that i takes every time you charge it and when it is done charging The voice is loud and cant turn it down .,-1
Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.,1
- Battery not changeable ( not a big deal,-1
This is the cutest Dust plug .,1
We have been very pleased with the fit,1
On the holster there is a spring loaded clip that brakes a bit to early and often .,-1
I ca n't figure out what is wrong ??,-1
Please keep in mind that I have used at least 10 different headsets over the years ( including Jawbone,0
I prefer keeping my phone in my front shirt pocket,0
The defender is a bit bulky for my tastes,-1
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,-1
She keeps telling me how much she appreciates this headset .,1
Forget about it on textured plastic .,-1
So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.,-1
It 's lock feels the same and seems to be of the same quality as that of an apple produced accessory .,1
In addition to the four standard Android touch keys below it,0
Its just sooo beautiful like nothing you ever seen before I just Thank You .,1
Doesn't Work.,-1
Krussel Always good.,1
Low Quality.,-1
I 'm sure there is a proper anatomical name for that,0
I used several type of Anker battery for Samsung Note 2,0
I fear it may get damaged over time .,-1
The card slots are to big for credit cards and anything else you want to put into it .,-1
It does everything the description said it would.,1
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.,-1
This was to replace my old Jabra Wave headset .,0
There are two ports on it : one 1.5 A micro-USB input for charging the battery unit,0
I recommend buying this case,1
I 've had this screen protector for a couple of months now and I love it,1
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.,-1
I finally returned it and went back to my ICON.Don ' t waste your money !,-1
The 1st battery is good so far .,1
Please note that the product will be coming from Hong Kong .,0
I made a mistake and purchase this case thinking that it was a defender case .,-1
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,-1
Thin enough to not add extra bulk to my phone but still has a small `` lip '' that i can toss my phone face down and not worry about the screen getting scratched on the table .,1
If you are searching for portability in a power bank,1
Very Dissapointing Performance.,-1
Have dropped several times with no damage .,1
It definitely was not as good as my S11.,1
They create air bubbles like crazy .,-1

The difference I 've found is the majority of the buttons have a cover,0
i guess the box just said that but I dont know .,0

I could hear a very faint hiss when using Bluetooth if I held the speaker to my ear ... but really though,-1
This is one of my favorite cases .,1
The colors are exactly what you see in photo .,1

Had some question about the color but it 's really great .,1
It has great sound for phone calls,1
I actually need to remove the ` phones to do the things I need to do while listening to music.All in all a good value and a decent listening experience for the money .,1
Only thing are the magnets are not very strong to keep the flap closed .,-1
The case is thin enough that I can now fit my phone into an alarm clock docking station ( my previous case was too bulky and I had to remove it to dock the phone ) .,1
We have paired it with a Zagg screen cover,0
The only solution thus far seems to be moving the hardware to your neckline away from those hotspots .,0
I never give a good rating if I have to call tech support.The biggest strength that the Jabra has is that I can hear my callers and they can hear me well .,-1
On the other hand the quality of the voice recognition for voice dialing/contact lookup is hilariously bad .,-1
But would n't recommend it .,-1
"The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.",1
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.,-1
I bought two of these just in case I might loose one !,0
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.,1
The case is an improvement over the Otterbox case .,1
so this was like a question mark for me if its really worth it .,0
This is a beautiful phone.,1
It worked very well.,1
It was handled by wet hands but it was never in direct contact of water .,0
Having so many electronic items that are constantly needing to be charged makes this a highly valuable and handy item to own .,1
It 's okay for clipping to your pocket,1
This charger works well in the car on a daily basis .,1
My favorite feature is the U-Focus which blurs the background and focuses on the object,1
I do n't find it as convenient on some of my larger devices,-1
You wo n't regret it as 1 tiny little dust speck can wreck havoc.One word of advise I do have however for the company regarding the video we received,1
Overall it 's a decent case for the price Just got my Nexus 5 today and popped in my phone .,1
I removed the plastic piece that projected the sticky part then placed my device onto it .,0
the red is not as true a color as on websites I would prefer a deeper / darker red .,-1
The contents came with 3 screen protectors,0
THey are so cool!,1
The quality seems to be fine .,1
We are sending it back.,-1
Durability and shock is pretty good but you dont get much from life case either in this catagory for there is no rubber or gel padding .,0
No packaging or anything.It fits perfectly .,1
$ 5.55 with free shipping !,1
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,-1
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.,-1
This case with velcro would be perfect .,1
Were JERKS on the phone.,-1
This product works exactly as was advertised .,1
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,1
Im guessing that it was n't completely dry :( .,-1
Should anything change I 'll be sure to upate the review .,0
The problem is that the charger supplied with the unit only provides 1.5 amps ( something I did n't even notice with the first unit -- I assumed it was a 2.0 amp charger ) .,-1
The design is very good.4.,1
Very disappointing.,-1
Horrible phone.,-1
This fixes all the problems.,1
It does not come pre-charged,-1
This is infuriating.,-1
You can throw this across the room and not damage the phone,1
"Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.",-1
I have had a HTC One V for awhile and have enjoyed it,1
"horrible, had to switch 3 times.",-1
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.,1
but i cant complain that much bc ever sense i put this case on i have dropped it like 4 times and one dent is pretty good .,1
Good product - incredible value.,1
I use to be an otterbox fan,0
Doesn't do the job.,-1
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.,1
After a couple of days of use,0
I 've been able to move just a few of the apps to the SD card but most do n't allow that .,-1
This feature is often advertised with these kinds of headphones,0
While not thin like a case-mate barely there,0
The feel was OK as well,1
worth the price This is a very unique cover at a super low price ... it is very good looking and feels super smooth so it is easy to slip into pants pockets . .,1
THanks I really liked the product,1
I &#8217; ve been using it for several days on PC and Mac,0
Very wind-resistant.,1
I use it without the removable loop and just jam it in my ear canal like an earbud .,0
It does n't have the in-the-ear fitting,-1
It is a two piece with a silicon interior wrapped with a harder plastic exterior .,0
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,1
They last FOREVER and they stick really good .,1
My favorite part is that it has a 2.1 A port to charge my iPad in my car.Here is my youtube review : -LSB- ... -RSB- This car charger does exactly what you would expect .,1
A huge improvement over the Optimus V,1
This is the best FM receiver I own ?,1
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,-1
This protector has protected my screen very well so far .,1
Long and short of the story : this product does not work.the most rubbish i have ever seen offered for sale.bought a nokia charger from amazon that worked and continues to work like a charm so i am REALLY disappointed .,-1
It also took nearly a month to get shipped .,-1
"very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.",1
Rather expensive but I personally think it 's worth it .,1
It is made of the same quality as the ones you purchase at your carriers store but with a 70 to 90 % discount .,1
This is a very rigid case that just did n't feel right to me .,-1
Its really nice looking but wont last and gets dirty really fast .,-1
This is a pretty nice little TPU case .,1
Good Quality.,1
- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry .,1
I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.,-1
I would give it 5 stars .,1
With the polycarb frame around the silicon,0
Battery is holding up well.,1
This Otterbox is my second smartphone Otterbox,0
Now I know that I made a wise decision.,1
New Battery works great in phone.,1
Even though it looks weird on the side ( slight-ripple fishskin-effect surface ) and slightly odd to touch,-1
( I have installed at least 16 on iPhones and iPads .,0
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,-1
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.,-1
They are very durable and they last a long time .,1
With no boom microphone sticking out I almost forgot I was wearing it .,1
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.,1
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.,-1
"Looks great and is strong.""",1
"The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.",1
The listening quality is pretty solid,1
Keep in mind there is only volume and pause/play controls at the bottom of device .,0
I purchased this to get wireless audio reception from an iPhone .,0
Look for a better one,-1
If you want guaranteed protection for your smartphone then you NEED to get the Otterbox Defender Series!I give it a 5/5 stars,1
The Goospery model adds slightly more bulk to the phone than past Mercury cases I have had for other phones .,-1
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,1
This is working out very well as an entry-level smart phone for my wife .,1
Keep up the good work Amazon!!,1
This item is a great buy for anyone who needs a first or replacement charger .,1
For $ 3 it is n't bad but it 's surely not worth more than that .,-1
i definitely recommend this product .,1
Nice headset priced right.,1
"I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.",-1
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.,-1
Soyo technology sucks.,-1
If not for windows 8 on my PC,0
The added LED flashlight was a really nice touch as is the longer USB cable .,1
The gold foil over the letters will come off,-1
The sound quality is excellent as well.,1
After the charging was completed,0
"It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.",1
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.,1
** Update ** this product has been working fine and for the most part it charges my samsung Galaxy S4 just fine .,1
Crisp and Clear.,1
I received this product to test,0
Between the gasket and the usb cover,0
Very good for business people .,1
The top left corner wo n't adhere to the phones glass .,-1
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.,1
- Love the flip-on/flip-off : saves valuable battery power when not in use,1
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!,-1
wont work right or atleast for me.,-1
Unfortunately that pair arrived damaged,-1
Bought this just food using as an mp3 player to listen to music while exercising and biking and it does the job very well,1
The credit card/ID slots are correct size and depth and the bracket for the phone fits securely .,1
It would be great for long airline flights where there is no power outlets on the plane or the airport .,1
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.,-1
I 'd rate the operational efficiency a C + at best .,-1
Would recommend this product to all new and old iPhone users .,1
It seems durable enough for normal use,1
Bad Reception.,-1
I will update further once we have used the headphones for a longer period of time .,0
It is brighter than the picture .,0
But I dare not go with out .,0
Current smart phones ( iPhone 4,0
WELL IM SATISFIED.,1
It 's worked great for months,1
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.,-1
There is some portion of it covering the sides of the screen as well which is pretty good .,1
It can be a trick to snap it in and out though,0
The top and bottom are completely open for full access to the power button and ports.Slim cases protect against scratches,1
Excellent bluetooth headset.,1
This is so much easier to carry throughout my day than car chargers or wall chargers,1
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.,-1
The color is way off,-1
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,1
After it died from the original charge,0
I just wished I received the case ( flip case w / window ) that is supposed to go with this though .,-1
Actually used it to replace my Odder Box that wore out .,0
One of my concerns in purchasing a case was making sure that it would n't make my phone bulky .,0
The advertising says this charger is specifically for the Samsung Galaxy SIII which is what I own .,0
"The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.",-1
You do have to open a flap to access the silent button,-1
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.,1
Product is exactly as described.,1
I ordered 3 of these as I break them a lot .,0
My phone is lasting about 10 hours or so,0
The case is still two piece like most Seidio products ( main piece is silicon,0
It would also not activat the part of the screen that i was tapping .,0
"The ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.",1
"What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...",-1
what a disappointment,-1
I already recommended this to my friend .,1
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,-1
What a waste of time!,-1
;) I use this in the kitchen on my painted wall .,1
"If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.",-1
This was heaven after purchasing additional batteries the product broke but the vendor replaced it with no problem and it was right away !,1
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.,1
"Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.",1
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.,1
I love the charger and I also love the price of the charger,1
:-( This case is great !,1
Think I 'll avoid &#34; bulk &#34; electronics - the savings are n't worth it .,-1
+ Speaker phone to accept calls !,1
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement,-1
disappointing.,-1
Accident prone might want to get a more cushioned case but this is perfect for my purposes .,1
This item fits the need and does it in a user friendly way.Also,1
The soft rubber outer layer provides a secure grip on the phone,1
What a waste of money and time!.,-1
I was provided a TechMatte ProGrip Universal Windshield Car Mount Holder/Cradle for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review,0
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!,1
HARASSMENT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND IS A CRIME !,-1

I have n't tested the USB port yet though .,0
"However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.",-1
IT'S REALLY EASY.,1
I purchased the case/holster bundle previously,0
The issues appear to be either or both of the following ... a ) As discussed below the software installed on the Galaxy S3 phone,-1
( using 3g ) - About 15 minutes of email checking,0
` Discharging ' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge .,0
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.,1
It 's only been a couple of weeks and already there is dust from my pocket that is starting to collect in this area .,-1
So glad I purchased this product .,1
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.,-1
I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.,1
The music quality is amazing and the phone call quality is much better than my iphone 's speakerphone .,1
I little more bulky than I would like .,-1
I have several car mounts for cell phones .,0
I got a spare Original Equipment Manufacturer battery and an extended life battery at the same time .,0
I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.,1
"Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.",-1
( Which I did n't want to do for various reasons . ),0
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,-1
I am thankful that it has secure connections on it .,1
"My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.",-1
I have only limited experience with iphones,0
Nice docking station for home or work.,1
sometimes i have to let the pen stay on the screen for a quick moment before lifting it .,0
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!,-1
I only sleep for 5.5-6 hours in the first place,0
You'll love how thin it is.,1
This is the case on my son 's phone .,0
I got a new T-Mobile Galaxy S3,0
the only reason I 'm not rating this item 1 star is I took a gamble to see if it would work with myPanasonic KX-TG6511B - it does n't : / i saw other products that were pricier that were explicit they work and this one was n'tso if you have a Panasonic cordless phone,-1
Painful on the ear.,-1
These things are so sparkly and cute and they work really great .,1
"It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.",-1
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,-1
Had to use one rather quickly & it worked great .,1
They really work well with my iphone and i had one in every car .,1
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.,1
VERY DISAPPOINTED.,-1
That 's to be expected though .,0
"Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.",-1
With a TPU case or silicone case,0
This case was actually for my mom and she is absolutely in love with it !,1
Never got it!!!!!,-1
I use my phone whenever I want,0
Earbud piece breaks easily.,-1
It fits the phnone fabulously,1
The top of the Diztronic matte TPU case has cutouts for the IR blaster,0
Plus it makes my new iPhone five look pretty sexy this is a great protection for your Iphone 5 it was everything was hoping it would be looks great on the phone and looks great !,1
wo n't hesitate to buy another .,1
It 's a little too big and heavy to carry around every day in a purse,-1
The back is also really disappointing,-1
May be a combination of where the antennas and the charging grid are in the phone .,0
Love this headset!,1
If Qualcomm get developers excited about making neat stuff for the Toq like they 've been trying to do for the Pebble,0
Unfortunately it did not work.,-1
I have tested and reviewed many battery cases -- ever since I had my first iPhone 3 -- and I ca n't believe I 'm this excited about the uNu Aero .,1
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.,1
The product never fully charges up .,-1
The cable is made durable and of high quality components .,1
-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann It comes in great packaging and it does what it says .,1
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.,-1
Have n't had the opportunity ( need ) to use it more than once,0
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.,-1
Not worth it.,-1
No worries though because synching this headset could n't have been easier .,1
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.,-1
It works well with my note and RND did a good job for a simple charger dock.It works well and syncs well .,1
"I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!",1
The tiny size of the Yubi however provides a very clean look .,1
If you travel a lot ?,0
And while in the holster,0
"I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.",1
"I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.",1
I 've tried to remove it once and it just was n't happening so I gave up .,-1
Pretty piece of junk.,-1
I wonder what they 've changed between revisions that causes this?PROBLEM 4 : Sync and charge behavior are frustratingly different with the new unit as well .,-1
This would n't be possible with a wired speaker and it 's loud enough that I can still hear his music when he 's all the way down the street .,1
I had seen similar cell phone cases at the mall for about $ 45 - $ 50,0
On other multiple times where this has been used we just charged the battery overnight.Considering how batteries can drain based upon usage or location,0
I think this is the best thing to use when you travel with the kids .,1
The magnetic catch will no fully prevent your phone from falling out,-1

"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all.",-1
Neither offer the consumer a comfortable evaluation level.One can only hope there will be better OEM firmware updates and better ` useful ' third party apps on the horizon .,-1
This holds phone securely yet phone removes easily .,1
If I ever need yet another one I will be buying this one .,1
I do n't worry about my phone if I drop it cuz it feels so protected .,1
Students will like having this one item that is a pen and a fluid stylus all in one product .,1

Defective crap.,-1
A pity about the lack of NFC,-1
worked as it should and it was overlla easy to install just see some youtube videos to install it safely Works perfect .,1
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.,1
Improper description.... I had to return it.,-1
But it 's a good value,1
I put the third screen protector on and made sure not to reposition it this time .,0
A pretty good product.,1
The only way to bump the numbers is to lower the screen brightness .,0

I received a plastic bag with one each of a large,0
It protects it front and back .,1

"Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.",1
Great phone.,1
I do n't really like it but I guess that 's my problem now !,-1
elago nailed both the design and feel with this model .,1
Basically the service was very bad.,-1
The only problem he had was the bottom of it would cover the mic sometimes so it would make him sound muffled .,-1
Your phone will be a brick .,-1
I suspect iPad users will be as pleased with the results as I was with my iPod Touch ( I will try it on an iPad and post an update ) .,1
Great bluetooth!.,1
good price and it fit snug .,1
Best headset ever!!!.,1
IR remote function works with the case on4 .,0
The battery lasts a reasonable time .,1
The recipient was delighted with the product .,1
I do agree with other reviewers that I wish it came with a lightning plug adapter .,-1
"None of it works, just don't buy it.",-1
Buy from AMAZON because the price is much much better than buying from the Blackberry website .,1
But it does n't at all sound like the sound is coming from inside my head .,-1
The DROID should start getting the same quality soon .,1
home and back buttons do n't work after installing protector while all of other screen surface does .,-1
The sticky pad proved too stick and stripped some of the color layer off .,-1
"Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!",-1
In addition some of the jewels are coming off,-1
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,1
With phones that are all touch screen,0
CA N'T BEAT IT .,1
I just was n't confident enough that I could make the precise cuts without damaging the data chip part of the SIM card .,0
I know style is not the key component in portable chargers but it is a &#34; must mention &#34; with the Jackery .,0
The earbuds are comfortable to wear and the sound is quite good for this price point.Bottom line : An easy way to listen to music on your iPhone and have quick access to it .,1
I highly recommend I do not recommend this case .,-1
smooth rubber with a hard plastic case in an awesome color !,1
We turn on the speaker,0
Very Displeased.,-1

"During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.",-1
so i bought it to fit over the extra battery cover Qi case from Samsung to wireless charge the phone but the case would not fit over the phone with the new wireless charging battery cover on it .,-1
If you 've never used a car dock regularly before,0
Probably enough protection over most compliant floor surfaces .,1
Great phone!.,1
The rest are in my junk drawer ... well,0

Magical Help.,1
Since I got this specifically for emergencies,0
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.,-1

I really like it and it slides on easy for me .,1

One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.,-1
Some people will not like it,-1
"My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.",1
"However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.",-1
This external battery really packs the power .,1
THAT one didn't work either.,-1
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,1
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.,-1
Fit is exactly like stock,1
So my phone will not fit .,-1
best bluetooth on the market.,1
